# CS224N:Deep Learning for Computer Vision
## [Stanford/Spring 2024]([https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/])
This repository contains my solutions of the assignments of the Stanford CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning course from spring 2024. There are many other great repositories on this course but none that cover the latest assignments (spring 2024) and contain the written and practical parts completely. This repository is intended as a learning ressource which provides answers if you are stuck. Please do yourself a favor and try it on your own first.

Reading papers is an important part of this course and crucial for completing the assignments successfully. Therefore I recommend to have a look at [How to read a Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)

For now, all assignments are completed. I will continue watching the rest of the lectures and come back in September this year to try completing one of the default projects.
